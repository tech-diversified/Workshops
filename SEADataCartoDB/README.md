# Tech Diversified Data/GIS Talk

This page contains relevant resources for finding data about Seattle, and tips on
performing spatial analysis with those data.

Notes regarding the [Bus Stops and POIs Map](https://td-data-workshop.cartodb.com/viz/67413342-2174-11e6-9958-0ecfd53eb7d3/public_map)
can be found [here](bus_amenity_analysis.markdown).

Additional (maybe helpful) notes on using CartoDB can be found [here](cartodb-notes.markdown)
